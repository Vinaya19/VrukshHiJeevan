			<h1> Our Story </h1><br>
			<div id="para">
			<p><i> Around 5 years ago, we as a group of students stumbled upon a article from a 2,000-year-old book called Vrikshayurvedam, during our group project which gave us great insight about trees and forests. Propelled by the idea, we started researching to learn more about the trees that grew well in our surroundings.</i> </p><br>
			<p><i>Starting around our house, we each planted some large shade trees and some fruit trees that could attract birds, squirrels and bats. Initially driving the initiative all by ourselves, we would gather on the weekends and debate about the choice of tree we would like to plant this week. The story which started as a innocent efforts became something more as the people around us started to notice this activities of ours.</i></p><br> 
			<p><i>The only problem was reachability.Our efforts were limited to our neighbourhood. So to overcome this we collectively as IT engineers at work and tree lovers at heart found 'VRUKSH HI JEEVAN'.Since then we have conducted many activities for which we have received heartwarming responses.</i></p>
